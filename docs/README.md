# Economic Victory Conditions

Economic victory conditions should be quite similar, so all the factions have the same objectives to achieve it. The
only exception are horde factions, which have to obtain money from raiding, as they can not hold settlements.

## Conditions 

### Normal factions

* Have at least 500000 money
* Have 90000 income at the start of the turn
* Have access to all the resources

### Horde factions

* Have at least 500000 money
* Earn 50000 from raiding
